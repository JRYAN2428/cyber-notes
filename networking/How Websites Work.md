# How Websites Work

## **Two major components of a website**
- The **Front End** (Client side); how the browser looks at the website
- The **Back End** (Server side); server processes request > returns response

## Primary methods of website creation:**
- HTML; builds websites and structure
- CSS; presentation-side
- JavaScript; Implement complex features, user interactivity

HTML = HyperText Markup Lnaguage
- Is the language websites are written in
- Elements = tags; vice versa; > Building blocks of HTML pages > Tells browser how to display content

**HTML STRUCTURE:**
- <!DOCTYPE html> defines the page as HTML5 doc. Standardisation
- <html> element/tag > root element of HTML page - ALL other elements/tags come after this element
- <head> element/tag contains information about the page like page title
- <body> defines HTML doc body; only content inside of the body is shown in the browser
- <p> defines a paragraph
There are many other elements/tags******
