# Room Name (TryHackMe)

## 1. Summary  
A short explanation of what the room covers.  
Include the core topics, tools, and concepts introduced.

**Example format:**
- What the room teaches  
- Key protocols/services  
- Main goals or challenges  

---

## 2. My Understanding  
Rewrite the concepts in your own words.  
Focus on clarity and what *you* understand, not what THM wrote.

**Prompts to help you write this section:**
- How does the technology work?  
- Why is it used?  
- What problem does it solve?  
- How does it fit into the bigger picture of cybersecurity?  

Use bullet points or short paragraphs.

## 3. Hands-On Tests (Commands + Output + Interpretation)  
This is the practical evidence of your learning.

### Commands I ran
(command here)

shell
Copy code

### Output
(output snippet here)

markdown
Copy code

### My Interpretation  
Describe what the output *means*.  
This is the most important part for demonstrating skill.

**Prompts:**
- What did this command reveal?  
- Why is this output important?  
- What does this tell me about the target, protocol, or behaviour?  

Repeat this pattern for each experiment.

You can test:
- curl  
- dig  
- nmap  
- gobuster  
- SMB enumeration  
- viewing HTML  
- inspecting headers  
- simple Python http.server tests  
- or anything relevant to the room  

Feel free to add screenshots in an `/images` folder if needed.

## 4. Reflection  
A short self-assessment section.

**Include:**
- What I learned  
- What I struggled with  
- What I need to revisit later  
- How this connects to other topics  
- Any mistakes I made and corrected  

This section shows growth and critical thinking.
